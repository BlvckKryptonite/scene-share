## **Real-World Rationale**

In today‚Äôs digital entertainment landscape, movie enthusiasts seek platforms that go beyond passive viewing ‚Äî they want community, curation, and conversation. However, many existing services either lock these features behind subscriptions or lack meaningful interactivity.

SceneShare addresses this gap by offering a streamlined space where users can:

- üçø Browse and review films through a structured, user-friendly interface.
- ‚≠ê Rate and reflect on movies they‚Äôve watched, fostering shared discovery.
- üé¨ Build and manage personalized watchlists, tracking what to watch next.

Designed with Django‚Äôs Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìTemplate (MVT) architecture, SceneShare demonstrates how a full-stack application can combine community engagement with individualized film management. <br><br> The platform‚Äôs emphasis on responsiveness, modularity, and user-centered design reflects real-world expectations of modern review and recommendation systems.

Ultimately, SceneShare provides a foundation for a vibrant review community ‚Äî illustrating how thoughtful web development can bring people together around media stories that inspire, challenge, and entertain.

# **User Experience (UX)**

---

### **Project Goals**
- Provide a user-friendly movie review and watchlist platform.
- Allow users to add, view, and edit their movie reviews.
- Enable rating-based insights to guide other users‚Äô film selections.
- Provide a simple, responsive interface with visual confirmation for key user actions.

### User Interface
The initial design emphasized a clean, simple and intuitive layout built with the Bootstrap grid system, allowing users to easily browse popular movies on the homepage and search for their favorite titles. A hand-drawn wireframe of the original concept is shown below:

<br>

<div align="center">
  <img src="static/images/wireframe.jpg" alt="Sceneshare hand-drawn wireframe sketch" width="800">
  <p><em>SceneShare hand-drawn wireframe sketch</em></p>
</div>

<br>

The first implemented version of the platform is shown below, reflecting the transition from the initial wireframe concept to a functional interface:

<br>

<div align="center">
  <img src="static/images/version1.png" alt="Sceneshare version 1 screenshot" width="800">
  <p><em>SceneShare version 1 - Bootstrap styling</em></p>
</div>

<br>

### **Design Choices**
---

While the initial version of SceneShare was functional, it lacked the level of polish and modern aesthetic I envisioned. Furthermore, because the original review system relied on basic radio inputs, dynamically rendering star ratings for reviewers with JavaScript while maintaining consistent element display proved challenging when **only** using Bootstrap.
<br><br>
To achieve greater control and versatility, I transitioned to custom styling. Below are some of the key design changes implemented:

- **Custom Styling:** Replaced Bootstrap‚Äôs default styling and grid system with vanilla HTML and custom CSS. Since multiple templates had to be developed, I initially wrote inline CSS for each page to isolate and test individual components before consolidating them into a single main stylesheet during the later stages of development.
- **Custom Form Styling:** Replaced Django‚Äôs default crispy forms and Bootstrap with a custom-styled UI for greater control and visual consistency.  
- **Authentication:** Implemented a **custom user registration and login system** instead of the prebuilt Django AllAuth for more flexibility and cleaner integration. (AllAuth integration is planned for future iterations to enable Google/Facebook login.)  
- **Feedback System:** Introduced **visual confirmation messages** later in development to address usability gaps‚Äîusers now receive immediate confirmation after posting or editing reviews.  
- **JavaScript Refactoring:** All Javascript code was moved to a standalone file for clarity and validation compliance.  

<br><br>
The final iteration adopted a hybrid approach, merging features from the initial layout with the dark mode aesthetic developed in a separate movie watchlist project. A screenshot of the Figma design file is shown below, and [the live link is provided for reference](https://www.figma.com/design/2PZDPDM0KO42hHp0lHsygM/Movie-Watchlist---Muma?node-id=0-1&p=f).

<br>


<br><br>

# **Agile Methodology**

Development followed **Agile principles** using GitHub Issues and a Kanban board.  
- Each issue represented an epic, with sub-issues containing actionable tasks and user stories.
- Larger features were divided into **sub-issues** for incremental progress tracking.  

This approach ensured an iterative, test-driven workflow aligned with the project scope, deadlines, and overall structure.

<br>

---

## **User Stories**

All user stories were tracked and managed using Agile methodology on GitHub Projects (Kanban board format). The complete project board, including all epics, issues, sub-issues, and user stories, [can be accessed here](https://github.com/users/BlvckKryptonite/projects/4/views/1).

Below is a refined version of initial user stories, scribbled down prior to development to cover different user perspectives:

<br>

| As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can ... |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Site Visitor | View a list of movies | Discover films worth watching |
| Registered User | Add movies to my watchlist | Keep track of what I plan to watch |
| Reviewer | Post a review for a movie | Share my thoughts and ratings |
| Reviewer | Edit or delete my reviews | Correct mistakes or change opinions |
| User | Receive confirmation when I submit a review | Know that my action succeeded |
| Admin | Manage movie entries and user submissions | Maintain platform integrity |
| Developer | Keep JS, CSS, and templates organized | Ensure code maintainability |
| Reviewer | Access my watchlist and reviews easily | Manage my movie engagement |
| Admin | Validate and document code thoroughly | Ensure project quality and scalability |



<br><br>

# **Database Design**

---

SceneShare was structured around Django‚Äôs ORM with custom models across three custom apps:
- **Movie app** 
    - Movie model - represents a movie with details such as title, description, release year and poster.
    - Review model - linked to both User and Movie, containing rating and review text.
    - Watchlist - enables users to add or remove movies from their personalized list.  
- **Accounts app** ‚Äì extended from Django‚Äôs default model with custom authentication logic.  
    - Profile - extends the built-in User model with additional profile information.
- **Community App** - interacts with both the movie and accounts apps. Responsible for community features and interaction between users.
    - ReviewLike - represents a 'like' given by a user to a movie review.
    - Comment - represents a comment given by a user to another user's review
    - ProfileView - allows users to click other user's profiles.
<br><br>

A hand-drawn **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** was used in early design stages to map out the relationships. Below is the aforementioned ERD enhanced with AI for clarity:

<br>

<div align="center">
  <img src="static/images/erd-diagram.png" alt="Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)" width="800">
  <p><em>Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)</em></p>
</div>

<br>


**Model Methods Implemented:**
- `get_average_rating()` ‚Äî Calculates the average rating for each movie.  
- `__str__()` ‚Äî Returns human-readable representations for admin and debugging.  
- Slug generation for URL identifiers.  


<br><br>

# **Features**

---


### **Implemented Features**
I. **User Authentication** ‚úÖ 
- Custom sign-up, login, and logout functionality.  
- Form validation and error messaging.  

II. **Movie Listing & Detail Views** ‚úÖ 
- Dynamic pages display movie details and user reviews.  
- Slug-based URLs ensure clean and descriptive routing.  

III. **Review System** ‚úÖ 
- Authenticated users can submit, edit, and delete reviews.  
- Ratings integrated into movie detail pages.  
- Confirmation messages provide feedback on successful submission.  

IV. **Watchlist Management** ‚úÖ 
- Users can add movies to a personal watchlist.  
- Accessible from the profile menu.  

V. **Responsive Frontend** ‚úÖ 
- All CSS refactored and validated through W3C tools.  
- Clean, minimal interface built with custom CSS (Bootstrap replaced).  

VI. **Code Quality** ‚úÖ 
- Docstrings and inline comments added for maintainability.  
- JavaScript and Python logic separated for clarity and validation compliance.  

<br><br>

---

## **Future Features**

The following features were planned but deliberately postponed to maintain a clear MVP scope. While interactive, some functionalities - such as comment threads ‚Äîc ould detract from the app‚Äôs main purpose: allowing users to **review movies and manage watchlists efficiently**.
<br><br>
Keeping the platform lean ensures that users can quickly see what others think about a movie without unnecessary clutter. Users can still engage with reviews through a ‚Äúlike‚Äù system to highlight helpful or insightful opinions.

Potential future enhancements include:

- **Comment Threads** üó®Ô∏è ‚Äî Enable users to comment on individual reviews.  
- **User Profiles** üë§  ‚Äî Allow viewing of other users‚Äô profiles and their movie activity.  
- **Social Authentication** üîê  ‚Äî Integration of Django AllAuth for Google/Facebook sign-ins.  
- **Community Feed** üì∞ ‚Äî Provide real-time updates of trending movies and popular reviews.  

<br>

**Rationale for exclusion:**

Adding these features would have increased database and view complexity, potentially detracting from the project‚Äôs core functionality. The app remains focused, streamlined, and aligned with the agile and MVP goals.

<br><br>

# **Technologies Used**

---

| Category | Technology |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (modularized) |
| **Backend** | Python 3, Django Framework |
| **Database** | SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (Heroku deployment) |
| **Version Control** | Git & GitHub |
| **Deployment** | Heroku |

<br><br>

# **Testing**

---

A combination of extensive automated and manual tests was implemented across key components of the application to ensure reliability, maintainability, and consistent functionality after code changes.

- All views, models, and forms were tested using Django‚Äôs built-in **`TestCase` framework** and executed with:  
<br>  
  ```bash
  python3 manage.py test


### **30 tests executed successfully without errors below ‚úÖ**

<br>

<div align="center">
  <img src="static/images/comprehensive-unit-tests.png" alt="Site-wide automated test results screenshot" width="800">
  <p><em>Automated unit test results across all apps</em></p>
</div>

<br>

## Comprehensive Testing Breakdown:

Extensive unit tests were implemented across all key Django app modules to verify functionality, reliability, and integration between components.

Each test suite was executed using Django‚Äôs built-in test runner, for example:

        python3 manage.py test movies --verbosity=2
        python3 manage.py test accounts --verbosity=2
        python3 manage.py test reviews --verbosity=2

<br>

All tests were run locally using the development SQLite database (üíæ Using local SQLite database), and all test cases passed successfully.

During testing, Django automatically creates a temporary test database, applies migrations, and tears it down after completion ‚Äî ensuring that no production or development data is affected.

<br>

## Test Coverage Overview

### 1. Movies App

A dedicated test suite was implemented to verify the stability and reliability of the Movies app. Given the app‚Äôs complexity and central role in the project, it contains the majority of the overall test coverage. To maintain structure and clarity, a separate `tests` directory was created, containing four focused test modules ‚Äî `test_forms.py`, `test_models.py`, `test_urls.py`, and `test_views.py`.

Each test class includes detailed docstrings for clarity and maintainability.  

**Tests covered:**

- **Models:** Validates successful creation and string representation of movie instances.
- **Views:** Confirms accessibility of key movie-related views and correct template rendering.
- **Forms:** Tests form validation logic, including required fields and handling of invalid inputs.
- **Urls:** Confirms correct URL resolution, template context, and expected HTTP status codes.

<br>

üìÑ **To run tests in a specific test file**

For example running only the tests from test_views.py inside the movies app:

    python3 manage.py test movies.tests.test_views --verbosity=2

<br>

<div align="center">
  <img src="static/images/movies-views-test-results.png" alt="Movies app test_views.py results screenshot" width="700">
</div>

<br>

üß© **To run all comprehensive tests in the app:** 

    python3 manage.py test movies --verbosity=2


**Result:**

 - All model tests passed with no errors ‚úÖ

<br>

### 2. Accounts app

Comprehensive tests were written for the **Accounts** app to ensure smooth user registration, profile management, and authentication flows.

This app‚Äôs tests are contained in a single file, focusing on validating model integrity, form handling, and authenticated view behavior.

**Tests covered:**

- **Models:** Verifies that a `Profile` instance is automatically created for each new `User`, and confirms the correct string representation of profiles.
- **Views:** 
    - **Register View:** Ensures the registration page renders properly on GET requests and successfully creates a user on valid form submission.
    - **Profile View:** Confirms that authenticated users can access and update their profiles, including username and bio changes, and receive success messages upon update.
- **Integration:** Validates signal functionality to automatically link and save user profiles after user creation or updates.

<br>

 **Command Used:**

    python3 manage.py test accounts --verbosity=2

**Result:** All six tests passed successfully ‚úÖ

<br>

<div align="center">
  <img src="static/images/accounts-tests.png" alt="Accounts app unit test results screenshot" width="700">
  <p><em>Accounts app test reults</em></p>
</div>

<br>

### 2. Community app

The **Community app**‚Äôs test suite focuses on validating the like/unlike system for movie reviews through the `ReviewLike model` and related view logic.

These tests ensure that user interactions such as liking, unliking, and authentication checks function correctly through both backend logic and JSON responses.

**Tests covered:**

- **Models:** Validates the string representation of the `ReviewLike` model for accurate and readable output.
- **Views:** 
    - Confirms that only authenticated users can like or unlike reviews.
    - Ensures proper JSON responses are returned on successful like/unlike actions, including updated like counts and status flags.
    - Tests that invalid request methods (like GET) return appropriate error messages and status codes.
- **Integration:** Ensures consistency between related models (`Review`, `Movie`, and `User`) during like/unlike toggling operations.

<br>

 **Command Used:**

    python3 manage.py test community --verbosity=2

**Result:** All four tests passed successfully ‚úÖ

<br>

<div align="center">
  <img src="static/images/community-tests.png" alt="Community app unit test results screenshot" width="700">
  <p><em>Community app test reults</em></p>
</div>

<br><br>


## **Manual Testing**

In addition to the automated Django test suite, extensive **manual testing** was performed to verify that all key features function as intended.

Testing covered authentication, CRUD operations, navigation flow, and overall user interface responsiveness across different devices.

During user-based testing sessions, it was discovered through test users that certain interactions, such as submitting or editing reviews, lacked clear confirmation of success.

To improve user experience, **visual feedback messages** were implemented throughout the site. These appear upon successful actions (e.g., review submission, profile update) and automatically disappear after a short delay using basic `setTimeout` JavaScript for smoother UX.


### Manual Functional Testing

Each core feature was manually tested to confirm successful operation.  
Below are example screenshots you can include:


| Test | Description | Screenshot Placeholder |
|------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Add Review** | Successful review submission with success message | ![Add Review Screenshot](static/images/review-sucess.png) |
| **Edit Review** | Edited review displayed correctly | ![Edit Review Screenshot](docs/screenshots/edit-review.png) |
| **Delete Review** | Review removed successfully | ![Delete Review Screenshot](docs/screenshots/delete-review.png) |
| **Watchlist Management** | Add/remove movies from watchlist | ![Watchlist Screenshot](docs/screenshots/watchlist.png) |
| **Authentication Flow** | Login and logout confirmation | ![Auth Screenshot](docs/screenshots/auth.png) |



| Feature | Test Scenario | Expected Outcome | Result | Pass/Fail |
|----------|----------------|------------------|---------|------------|
| **Registration** | Submit valid form data | Account is created and user redirected to home page | Works as expected | ‚úÖ Pass |
| **Login/Logout** | Enter correct credentials / click logout | Login grants access to dashboard; logout redirects to home | Works as expected | ‚úÖ Pass |
| **Add Review** | Submit a review on a movie detail page | Review is saved and visible immediately with confirmation message | Works as expected | ‚úÖ Pass |
| **Edit Review** | Edit an existing review and resubmit | Updated review replaces old version | Works as expected | ‚úÖ Pass |
| **Delete Review** | Click delete on own review | Review is removed from page and database | Works as expected | ‚úÖ Pass |
| **Watchlist Add/Remove** | Add or remove movies | Watchlist updates dynamically | Works as expected | ‚úÖ Pass |
| **Visual Confirmation** | Submit form on various pages | Success message appears on each relevant page | Works as expected | ‚úÖ Pass |
| **Navigation** | Click all nav links on desktop/mobile | All pages load correctly, responsive layout retained | Works as expected | ‚úÖ Pass |
| **Form Validation** | Submit invalid or empty fields | Errors displayed, submission blocked | Works as expected | ‚úÖ Pass |
| **Responsive Design** | Test on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, mobile viewports | Layout adjusts and remains readable | Works as expected | ‚úÖ Pass |

# Deployment

---

### Heroku Deployment Steps

1. **Create a new Heroku app** and connect your GitHub repository.

2. In your terminal, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip3 install gunicorn dj_database_url psycopg2

3. Create a Procfile in the project root directory with the following line:
   ```bash
   web: gunicorn sceneshare.wsgi

4. Set environment variables on Heroku:
    - SECRET_KEY

    - DATABASE_URL

    - DEBUG=False

5. Migrate the database:
   ```bash
   heroku run python manage.py migrate

6. Deploy and verify the live version using the link below: 

üîó Live App: https://sceneshare-0073094647bb.herokuapp.com/

### **7. Deployment Verification**

**Screenshot:**  
![Live Deployment Screenshot](docs/screenshots/heroku-deployment.png)


---

## **Deployment Verification Checklist**

This section outlines the full deployment process, configuration steps, and environment setup used to deploy **SceneShare** to Heroku.

### **1. Project Setup**
- Cloned repository from GitHub using:
  git clone https://github.com/<username>/sceneshare.git

- Created and activated a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate


- Installed all dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 

### 2. Django Configuration

- Created .env file (excluded from version control via .gitignore).

    - Added the following environment variables:

        * SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>
        * DEBUG=False
        * DATABASE_URL=<your_postgresql_database_url>
        * ALLOWED_HOSTS=['sceneshare-0073094647bb.herokuapp.com', 'localhost', 127.0.0.1]


- Updated settings.py to:

    * Use os.environ.get() for sensitive keys.

    * Configure static and media files for Heroku.

    * Set DEBUG=False in production.

## 3. Database Setup

- Initially used SQLite3 for local development.

- For production, the project was migrated to PostgreSQL on Heroku, since Heroku‚Äôs filesystem is ephemeral ‚Äî meaning any data stored locally is lost after each deployment or dyno restart.

- Using PostgreSQL ensures that user data (e.g., reviews, comments, and accounts) persists reliably across app restarts and updates. 

### Configuration

- To enable PostgreSQL support and prepare the project for Heroku deployment, the following dependencies were installed:
   ```bash
   pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2 gunicorn

- Heroku automatically provides a DATABASE_URL environment variable for the PostgreSQL add-on. In settings.py, I updated DATABASES to reference DATABASE_URL. the configuration is typically handled using dj_database_url to parse this URL:
   ```bash
   import os
   mport dj_database_url

  DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.config(
        default=os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'),
        conn_max_age=600,
        ssl_require=True
    )
    }

- Ran migrations:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py migrate

## 4. Static Files

- Created and configured the STATIC_ROOT directory in settings.py.

- Ran collectstatic:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py collectstatic


## 5. Heroku Deployment

- Logged into Heroku and created a new app:

- heroku login
- heroku create sceneshare

- Connected GitHub repository via Heroku dashboard.

- Added Config Vars under Settings ‚Üí Reveal Config Vars:

    * SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, DEBUG=False, DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1

- Created a Procfile in the root directory:
   ```bash
   web: gunicorn sceneshare.wsgi


- Pushed changes to the repository's main branch then clicked 'Deploy Branch'

- Once deployed, ran migrations on Heroku:
   ```bash
   heroku run python3 manage.py migrate


- Created a superuser for admin access:
   ```bash
  heroku run python3 manage.py createsuperuser
